  Dear Editor,
  <p>Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript entitled RAD-21-3310, "Abbreviated Screening Breast MRI for Women with a Personal History of Breast Cancer: Comparison with Full-Protocol MRI Using Propensity Score Matching”.
  We have closely reviewed the comments raised by the editor and reviewers and revised the manuscript according to their suggestions. We would like to change the title of the manuscript to “Abbreviated Screening MRI for Women with a History of Breast Cancer: Comparison with Full-Protocol MRI” in agreement with the Scientific Editor’s suggestion.
  We hope that our revised manuscript satisfies the addressed issues.<br>
  Thank you very much.</p>
  Sincerely yours,<br>
